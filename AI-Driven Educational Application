AI-Driven Educational Application 🎓🤖

An intelligent system that transcribes lecture videos, generates concise educational summaries, and formats them into downloadable PDF notes using state-of-the-art AI models like Whisper, Mistral, and Sentence Transformers.

🚀 Features

✅ Upload and transcribe lecture videos using OpenAI Whisper
✅ Extract key concepts using Sentence Transformers
✅ Summarize educational content using Mistral-7B or Falcon-7B Instruct models
✅ Automatically generate and download well-structured PDF notes
✅ BeautifulSoup-powered web scraping for relevant content enrichment

🧠 How It Works
	1.	Upload a video file (.mp4, .mov, etc.)
	2.	Whisper transcribes the lecture audio into readable text
	3.	Sentence Transformers embed and extract meaningful segments
	4.	A summarization model (Mistral-7B or Falcon-7B) condenses the content
	5.	FPDF creates a polished, ready-to-use study note in PDF format

🛠️ Tech Stack
	•	Python
	•	Google Colab
	•	Whisper (OpenAI)
	•	Sentence Transformers
	•	Hugging Face Transformers (Mistral-7B, Falcon-7B)
	•	BeautifulSoup (for additional content scraping)
	•	FPDF (PDF generation)

📥 Installation & Usage

Run this project in Google Colab for the best experience.

Step-by-Step:
	1.	Open the Colab Notebook
	2.	Upload your lecture video when prompted.
	3.	Authenticate with Hugging Face.
	4.	Let the model transcribe, summarize, and generate your notes.
	5.	Download the generated PDF directly.

Note: Internet access and Hugging Face account login are required.

🧪 Example Use Cases
	•	Students summarizing semester-long lecture recordings
	•	Teachers creating condensed notes for online/offline distribution
	•	Content creators making highlight documents for educational videos

🎖 Achievements

This system demonstrates the powerful synergy of Whisper transcription and transformer-based summarization, helping bridge the gap between raw video content and accessible learning material.
